There are pending changes in your workspace.

You can continue with the switch operation or cancel the switch and open a Pending Changes view, so that you can checkin (or undo) the pending changes. Then, you can run the "{0}" command again.

If you continue with the switch operation, your local changes won't be lost, and will still appear as pending changes after the switch operation.

== SwitchToLabelExplanation ==
There are pending changes in your workspace.

You can continue with the switch operation or cancel the switch and open a Pending Changes view, so that you can checkin (or undo) the pending changes. Then, you can run the "Switch workspace to this label" command again.

If you continue with the switch operation, your local changes won't be lost, and will still appear as pending changes after the switch operation, but you won't be able to submit these changes, as a label configuration is a read-only configuration.

To modify a labeled configuration, create a branch, setting the label as the branch base. Then, switch the workspace to that branch and make changes as usual.

== NewCertificateTitle ==
Server SSL certificate is not in the store

== NewCertificateMessage ==
The server you are connecting to has sent a certificate which is not in the store. This is normal if it is the first time you connect to this server.

            Certificate details:.
            - Issued to: {0}
            - Issued by: {1}
            - Expiration date: {3}
            - Certificate hash: {5}

            If you trust this host, hit "Yes" to add the key to the Plastic SCM key store (recommended if it is the first time you connect to this server).
            If you want to carry on connecting just once, without adding the key to the store, hit "No".
            If you do not trust this host, hit "Cancel" to abandon the connection.

== ExistingCertificateChangedTitle ==
Server certificate has changed!

== ExistingCertificateChangedMessage ==
WARNING: this host certificate does NOT match the one you have in the key store. It may mean that the server identity has been compromised or a man-in-the-middle attack is being performed on you.

            Certificate details:
            - Issued to: {0}
            - Issued by: {1}
            - Expiration date: {3}
            - Certificate hash: {5}

            If you were expecting this change and trust the new certificate, hit "Yes" to add the key to the Plastic SCM key store and trust this certificate in the future.
            If you want to carry on connecting just once, without adding the key to the store, hit "No".
            If you want to abandon this connection, hit "Cancel". This is the ONLY guaranteed safe choice.

== InvalidCertificateHostnameTitle ==
Hostname mismatch in secure connection

== InvalidCertificateHostnameMessage ==
WARNING: the hostname provided in the server certificate does NOT match the server hostname. This means that the certificate was not issued to this hostname or that there is a network configuration problem with this host.

            - Certificate hostname: {0}
            - Server hostname: {1}

            If you want to continue connecting to this host, choose "Yes". The certificate validation will continue (not recommended).
            If you want to abandon the connection, choose "No" (recommended).

== EncryptionConfigurationRemarks ==
Remarks:
            * Be very careful with the encryption password: it's the only way to decrypt your data on server '{0}'.
            * If you're decrypting data and you enter a wrong password, data will fail to decrypt and you will have to edit cryptedservers.conf on your client to fix it.
            * Be careful to use the same password (encryption key) company-wide to work with '{0}'. Otherwise, data will be encrypted differently in each client.

== PendingChangesWhatToShowDialogTitle ==
Configuración de los tipos de cambios a mostrar

== PendingChangesWhatToShowDialogExplanation ==
Desde el refresco automático hasta decidir si ver ficheros privados, ignorados y más

== PendingChangesMoveDetectionDialogTitle ==
Ajustar cómo encontrar ficheros y directorios movidos en el workspace

== PendingChangesMoveDetectionDialogExplanation ==
Puede detectar ficheros y directorios que se han movido o renombrado en disco

== PendingChangesAdvancedMoveDetectionDialogTitle ==
Se puede acelerar la detección de cambios usando NTFS journal

== PendingChangesAdvancedMoveDetectionDialogExplanation ==
Es una funcionalidad avanzada útil para realizar refactors complejos pero hay que usarla con cuidado

== PendingChangesFilesystemWatcherEnabled ==
El File System Watcher está habilitado

== PendingChangesFilesystemWatcherDisabled ==
El File System Watcher está deshabilitado

== PendingChangesFilesystemWatcherEnabledExplanation ==
Plastic monitoriza el workspace para acelerar la detección de cambiados. Esto elimina la necesidad de recorrer la estructura de directorios, aunque calcular los movidos todavía podría ser lento.

== PendingChangesFilesystemWatcherDisabledExplanation ==
Esto no es normal y puede afectar al rendimiento. Plastic monitoriza los cambios del workspace usando la API de Windows. De esta forma, no es necesario recorrer la estructura de directorios. Contacte con el equipo de soporte para obtener ayuda, a menos que esté desactivado en client.conf intencionadamente. [[HELP_URL|{0}]]

== PendingChangesShowCheckouts ==
Mostrar checkouts

== PendingChangesShowCheckoutsExplanation ==
Muestra los ficheros en checkout en Plastic, también los ficheros movidos usando las GUIs o línea de comandos. Finalmente, los ficheros involucrados en un proceso de merge. Los checkouts se muestran superrápido porque están en una lista y no es necesario recorrer la estructura de directorios para encontrarlos

Consejo: Para workspaces grandes (los mayores de 800k ficheros), puede tener sentido usar sólo checkouts y no cambiados. Los checkouts también son necesarios si se usa bloqueo de ficheros

== PendingChangesFindChanged ==
Buscar ficheros cambiados en el workspace

== PendingChangesFindChangedExplanation ==
Recorre la estructura de directorios del workspace para encontrar los ficheros cambiados (fecha de modificación cambiada)

== PendingChangesCheckFileContent ==
Verifica el contenido del fichero y no sólo la fecha para marcarlo como cambiado

== PendingChangesCheckFileContentExplanation ==
Cuando la fecha de un fichero es modificada, también verifica si el hash del fichero ha cambiado. Útil con aplicaciones que guardan ficheros sin realizar ningún cambio. Advertencia: puede hacer que la vista de "cambios pendientes" sea más lenta porque requiere leer y calcular el hash de los ficheros.

== PendingChangesAutoRefresh ==
Autorefresco

== PendingChangesAutoRefreshExplanation ==
Refresca automáticamente la lista de Cambios Pendientes cuando es necesario y evita el refresco manual.

== PendingChangesGroupInChangeLists ==
Agrupa cambios en "listas de cambios"

== PendingChangesGroupInChangeListsExplanation ==
Plastic puede agrupar los cambios en el workspace en listas creadas por el usuario. Esto es útil si echa de menos la funcionalidad de otros controles de versiones anteriores (P4).

== PendingChangesShowPrivateFiles ==
Mostrar ficheros privados

== PendingChangesShowPrivateFilesExplanation ==
Lista ficheros que no están bajo el control de versiones. Pueden ser ficheros añadidos recientemente, pero a veces son ficheros generados por herramientas que es mejor ignorar. (Añadirlos a "ignorados" puede ser una mejor opción).

== PendingChangesAlwaysSelectPrivateFiles ==
Seleccionar siempre ficheros privados

== PendingChangesAlwaysSelectPrivateFilesExplanation ==
De esta forma no se olvidará nuevos ficheros al hacer checkin, pero es necesario tener un buen ignore.conf para evitar añadir accidentalmente ficheros temporales al control de versiones.

== PendingChangesShowIgnoredFiles ==
Mostrar ficheros ignorados

== PendingChangesShowIgnoredFilesExplanation ==
Muestra los ficheros ignorados anteriormente al añadirlos a ignore.conf.

== PendingChangesShowHiddenFiles ==
Mostrar ficheros ocultos

== PendingChangesShowHiddenFilesExplanation ==
Muestra los ficheros que previamente se ocultaron al añadirse a hidden_changes.conf.

== PendingChangesShowDeletedFiles ==
Mostrar ficheros y directorios eliminados

== PendingChangesShowDeletedFilesExplanation ==
Muestra los ficheros borrados manualmente en el workspace fuera del control de Plastic. (Sin usar una GUI o un comando, sino simplemente borrándolos del disco).

== PendingChangesMoveDetectionExplanation ==
Se puede mover un fichero usando Plastic con "cm mv" o desde las GUIs o el plugin de un IDE. Este método no requiere "detección". Pero, si se mueven los ficheros directamente en disco, Plastic puede detectar la operación. También se aplica a directorios.

== PendingChangesFindMovedFiles ==
Buscar ficheros y directorios movidos y renombrados

== PendingChangesFindMovedFilesExplanation ==
Recorre el workspace buscando posibles movidos. Si se renombra foo.c a bar.c, Plastic encontrará bar.c como añadido, foo.c como eliminado, e intentará hacerlos coincidir. Puede ser lento si hay muchos ficheros privados.

== PendingChangesMoveDetectionFineTune ==
Ajustar cómo funciona la detección de movidos:

== PendingChangesMatchBinarySameExtension ==
Hacer coincidir ficheros binarios sólo cuando tengan la misma extensión

== PendingChangesMatchBinarySameExtensionExplanation ==
No intenta hacer coincidir un .png con un .jpg. Pero no encontrará un .doc renombrado a .docx.

== PendingChangesMatchTextSameExtension ==
Hacer coincidir ficheros de texto sólo cuando tengan la misma extensión

== PendingChangesMatchTextSameExtensionExplanation ==
No intenta hacer coincidir un .cs con un .c. Puede ser útil en algunas circunstancias.

== PendingChangesSimilarityPercentage ==
Porcentaje de similitud

== PendingChangesSimilarityPercentageExplanation ==
Define "cómo de parecidos" deben ser dos ficheros para que sean detectados como movidos o renombrados. Si se mueve foo.c a bar.c y se modifica más adelante, el % define cómo de parecidos deben ser para que Plastic los considere el mismo fichero.
También se aplica a los directorios: cómo de parecida debe ser la estructura del directorio: cuántos hijos movidos en relación con el total de entradas del directorio.
Para los binarios, el % significa la diferencia de tamaño permitida.

== PendingChangesEnableNTFSJournal ==
Habilita una monitorización precisa utilizando NTFS journal

== PendingChangesEnableNTFSJournalExplanation ==
Usa el NTFS journal para detectar ficheros y directorios movidos mientras la GUI está abierta. Es superpreciso y no hay "adivinanzas" ni heurísticas. NTFS sabe cuándo se mueve un fichero o un directorio.

Pero, hay un inconveniente: no es seguro usarlo si refactoriza un proyecto con herramientas como Visual Studio. Esto se debe a que VS no mueve simplemente foo.c a src/bar.c, sino que crea un nuevo src/bar.c, copia el contenido, y luego elimina foo.c. No hay forma de rastrearlo desde el sistema de ficheros.

Para un gran refactor usando el Explorador de Windows o la línea de comandos, funcionará sin problemas.

== PendingChangesChangeTrackerServiceNotRunning ==
El servicio Plastic Change Tracker no se está ejecutando

== PendingChangesChangeTrackerServiceNotRunningExplanation ==
No se puede comunicar con el servicio Plastic Change Tracker. Asegúrese de que esté instalado y funcionando.

== PendingChangesINotifyEnabled ==
inotify change watcher está habilitado

== PendingChangesINotifyDisabled ==
inotify change watcher está deshabilitado

== PendingChangesINotifyEnabledExplanation ==
Plastic monitoriza el workspace en busca de cambios para acelerar la operación. Esto elimina la necesidad de recorrer la estructura de directorios, aunque la búsqueda de movidos puede consumir tiempo. Plastic aprovecha inotify, pero necesita algunos ajustes para funcionar correctamente. Comprobar: {0}

== PendingChangesINotifyDisabledExplanation ==
El rendimiento de la vista de cambios pendientes mejora mucho cuando puede aprovechar el sistema de detección basado en inotify. Compruebe las siguientes instrucciones para habilitarlo: {0} y reinicie la GUI

Plastic SCM: Detected an unsupported Runtime Version. The Plastic SCM Filesystem Watcher is not compatible with this runtime, and has been disabled.This can affect to the Pending Changes view performance, and also causes that the auto - refresh feature for views is disabled. We strongly recommend upgrading to the.NET 4.x equivalent Runtime Version for a better experience.
